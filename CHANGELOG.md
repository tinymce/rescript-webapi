### 1.0 in progress

* Change all `send.pipe` externals to `send`, making them "t-first"
* Convert more input types to `node_like` and `element_like` to improve usability
* Consider switching to `namespace: true`, or otherwise improve the folder structure to avoid exposing the implementation modules
* Correct bugs, reduce how much code is generated, add missing APIs
* Switch this file to "keep a changelog" style
